Description: Support for macroecological analyses of time
    series. The intent of the package is to enable end users to run
    analyses on a collection of population and community time series data.
    Functions are provided to download and import datasets, produce
    reproducible workflows using the `drake` package, and for generating
    research compendia with code and reports.
