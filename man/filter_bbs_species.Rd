Modified from \url{https://github.com/weecology/bbs-forecasting}

Removes waterbirds, shorebirds, owls, kingfishers, knightjars,
dippers. These species are poorly sampled due to their aquatic or
noctural nature. Also removes taxa that were either partially unidentified
(e.g. "sp.") or were considered hybrids (e.g. "A x B") or were listed as more
than one species (e.g. "A / B")
}
