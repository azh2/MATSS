## Overview
The *MATSS* package is intended to support Macroecological Analysis of Time Series Structure. We provide functions to :
* gather ecological time series datasets
* build an analytical pipeline to conduct macroecological analyses on those datasets
* generate reports that collate results and summarize outputs

For more information about the datasets or analyses, please check out the vignettes.
For more information about contributing code, please check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
