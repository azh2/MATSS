# MATSS-pipeline

## Overview
This project is the development of a computational platform to serve as an analysis pipeline for [MATSS](https://github.com/weecology/MATSS)--Macroecological Analysis of Time Series Structure.

There are 2 main objectives:

* create an R package, *MATSS*, to enable programmatic access to different ecological time series datasets AND analysis methods
* support an automated pipeline to generate analyses, collate results, and identify broad patterns

For more information about the datasets or analyses, please check out the vignettes.
For more information about contributing code, please check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

You can install `MATSS` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("weecology/MATSS-pipeline")
```

## Examples

{add examples of using the `MATSS` package to get data and/or use the analysis methods}
