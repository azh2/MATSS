1,10,"Itasca State Park. Minnesota. is a 13 000-ha forestpreserve at 478N latitude. with a cold continental climate(mean annual temperature 3.78C. mean annualprecipitation 640 mm; Kuehnast 1972) and with diversesoils on glacial and meltwater deposits within a terminalmoraine. Forest cover in the 16-ha study area(T143N. R36W. Sec. 36. N?. NE?; pine?maple/BuddLake area of Webb [1988. 1989]) is heterogeneous withelements of northern hardwoods. white pine. red pine.and aspen?sugar maple cover types (Eyre 1980). Clustersof Pinus resinosa and scattered individual Pinusstrobus amidst hardwoods date back over 250 yr basedon our tree ring counts and originated after fire (Frissell1973; Clark 1989). The understory is also heterogenous.with thickets of Corylus cornuta shrubs. clumpsof the shrub Acer spicatum. carpets of seedlings of Acersaccharum and Acer rubrum. and patches of saplingsof Ostrya virginiana and Acer saccharum. The herbaceousflora is sparse and thus omitted from this analysis.Nomenclature follows Gleason and Cronquist 1991.METHODSPlots were sampled in mid-summer 1984. 1992. and1996. Each treefall had four 2 3 2 m plots: one plotnear the base (0.5 m north of the stump?s north edge).one plot in the fallen crown area (north of the bole justbeyond the first branch of the fallen crown). and twocontrol plots in parallel configuration at undamagedconspecific trees. Two base plots and three crown plotswere omitted due to interference from trails or treelesswet meadows. Note that plot locations were not permanentlymarked in the original survey. Thus. althoughthe treefall plots were likely to coincide in repeatedsampling. the control plots were less likely to be placedin exactly the same location in subsequent surveys. Ineach plot. all trees and shrubs were identified. counted.and recorded by height class (small. .50 cm in height;medium. 50-200 cm; tall. .200 cm in height. but dbh. 2.5 cm). Of 30 treefalls sampled originally in 1984.17 were still distinguishable in 1992. and 11 were distinguishablein 1996. In some cases. we are certain thatwe found the location of the old treefall. but the primarywindthrown tree had been obliterated by subsequenttreefalls. or (particularly for Betula papyrifera)entirely decomposed. Windthrown pines were still visibleand were all relocated. In contrast. fallen Populustremuloides. P. grandidentata. and other hardwoodswere less persistent. Any resulting bias in plot retrievalshould exaggerate the effects of windstorms. since largertreefalls were most likely to be included in the latersurveys. To accommodate decreasing sample size overtime. comparisons are based on densities per unit area.The data set contained a total of 58 individual plots in1984 and 1992. and 40 plots in 1996. Sample size wassufficient to reveal significant changes over time in thestatistical analysis; thus differences between treefalland control areas should also be detectable.We used repeated-measures ANOVA to identify differencesin vegetation that might be related to windstormdisturbance. The dependent variables. run one ata time. were species richness overall. for shrubs. andfor trees; and stem density by height class for all woodystems combined. for all shrubs. for all trees. and byspecies. The three independent variables. modeled together.were (1) treefall vs. control plot. (2) base vs.crown plot. and (3) year (1984. 1992. 1996). The base/crown factor was not significant and is not discussedhere. For those species for which ??year?? was significant.we checked for carry-over effects using a test forsphericity. In cases where the sphericity assumption ofthe univariate model was violated (the case of P .0.05). we tested again using a multivariate test that wasless powerful but more conservative (von Ende 1993;Norusis 1993).

16,57,"This data set is a derived data set based on fishcatch data. Data are collected annually to enableus to track the fish assemblages of elevenprimary lakes (Allequash. Big Muskellunge.Crystal. Sparkling. Trout. bog lakes 27-02 [CrystalBog] and 12-15 [Trout Bog]. Mendota. Monona.Wingra and Fish). Sampling on Lakes Monona.Wingra. and Fish started in 1995; sampling onother lakes started in 1981. Sampling is done atsix littoral zone sites per lake with seine. minnowor crayfish traps. and fyke nets; a boat-mountedelectrofishing system samples three littoraltransects. Vertically hung gill nets are used toobtain two pelagic samples per lake from thedeepest point. A trammel net samples across thethermocline at two sites per lake. In the bog lakesonly fyke nets and minnow traps are deployed.Parameters measured include species-levelidentification and lengths for all fish caught. andweight and scale samples from a subset. Deriveddata sets include species richness. catch per uniteffort. and size distribution by species. lake. andyear. Dominant species vary from lake to lake.Perch. rockbass. and bluegill are common. withwalleye. large and smallmouth bass. northernpike and muskellunge as major piscivores. Ciscohave been present in the pelagic waters of fourlakes. and the exotic species. rainbow smelt. ispresent in two. The bog lakes containmudminnows. Protocol used to generate data:Gill net data have been standardized to a 24-hoursampling period. Assumptions used in thestandardization are available from theinvestigators. Day seines were only used in 1981and have been eliminated from this data set tomake sampling effort across years comparable.Number caught for each species is summed overrepetitions of a gear within a lake and over depthFor information on fish stocking by WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resouces in LTER lakes inDane and Vilas counties. seehttp://infotrek.er.usgs.gov/doc/wdnr_biology/Public_Stocking/StateMapHot...

71,162,"Stations were randomly selected using EMAP's probabilistic sampling framework and were sampled once during a summer index period (June to October). A consistent suite of indicators was used to measure conditions in the water. sediment. and in benthic and fish communities.Different grab samplers were used by NCA partners. Young-modified Van Veen grab samplers. with a sampling area of 0.04 m2. were used by CT. DE. MA. NH. RI. and ME in both 2000 and 2001. NJ-Coastal and NJ-Delaware Bay used either a Ponar sampler (0.04 m2) or a Smith McIntyre sampler (0.1 m2) at stations in both years. NY used either a Young-modified Van Veen grab sampler (0.04 m2) or a Smith McIntyre sampler (0.1 m2) in 2000.One 'grab' sample was collected from each station using a Young-modifiedVan Veen grab sampler. The grabs were nominally 440 cm2 in area and 10cm deep. A sub-sample 2.5 cm in diameter and the depth of the grab wastaken from each grab for grain-size analysis. The remaining sedimentswere live-sieved in the field with a 0.5 mm mesh screen. Organismsretained on the screen were placed in plastic containers and fixed in10% buffered formalin with rose bengal stain for preservation. All taxa in a grab sample were sorted by a technician and thenidentified and counted by a skilled taxonomist. Only organisms largerthan 0.5 mm were processed; therefore groups such as turbellarianflatworms. nematodes. ostracods. harpacticoid copepods and foraminiferawere excluded from the identification process.

202,321,"Each rodent trapping web consists of a series of 12 equally spaced lines radiating from a central point. Each line consists of 12 trap stations. The first trap station is located 5 meters from the center. the next three at 5 meter intervals. and the remaining 8 at ten meter intervals. Each trap line is 100 meters long. and each web is 200 meters in diameter. The above rodent trapping web design has been used for six years at the Sevilleta LTER. and has recently been adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. as a standard technique for monitoring rodent populations. Small Mammals ------------- Rodent populations will be sampled from each of the three webs at each of the study sites twice each year. in the early (April-May) and late (September-October) summer. Sherman (H. B. Sherman Traps. Inc.. Tallahassee. FL) live-traps are left open for three consecutive nights. and captured animals are recorded for three consecutive mornings. Each animal caught is identified. measured. and released at the same location where it was captured. Each animal is temporarily marked with a marking pen to determine recapture status for a given three-night sampling period. No permanent marking techniques are used. Rodent trapping is conducted at all 6 webs at a given research site over the same 3 night period. Rodent trapping at the Sevilleta. Jornada. and Mapimi will be conducted at the same time of year. Persons working with rodents in the field will follow safety guidelines developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Mills. et al. in press). to reduce exposure to hantavirus. plague. and other rodent-vectored diseases. traps Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = Weight","traps"
